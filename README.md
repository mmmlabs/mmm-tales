### 1. **[Unveiling Incrementality and Causality: Moving Beyond Correlation in Marketing Mix Modeling](https://github.com/mmmlabs/mmm-tales/blob/main/The%20Placebo%20Test/True%20Incrementality%20and%20Causality.ipynb)**

   In this article, we explore the common pitfalls in Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM), particularly the confusion between correlation and causation. Traditional methods like OLS regression often misinterpret correlations as causation, leading to misguided decisions. However, by employing advanced techniques like Lasso regression, we demonstrate how to filter out noise and accurately identify the true drivers of sales. This approach reduces the risk of costly mistakes and improves the reliability of your marketing insights.
