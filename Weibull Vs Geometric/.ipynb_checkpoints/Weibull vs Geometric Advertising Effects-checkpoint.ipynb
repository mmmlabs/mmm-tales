    "# Capturing Delayed Advertising Effect with Weibull Transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to advertising, the impact isn’t usually immediate, it typically is delayed and unfolds over time. Traditional adstock models, such as geometric decay, assume an immediate impact followed by a consistent decline, which fails to account for delayed or more intricate advertising dynamics. For instance, upper-funnel advertisements, such as TV ads, require time for viewers to see the ad and even more time before they decide to purchase the product. To address this complexity, a more flexible modeling approach is necessary—one that ccaptures the delay effect as well as the memory effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations of Geometric Decay\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Geometric Adstock**: Assumes a fixed, immediate decline, which doesn’t match situations where advertising takes time to influence sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula**:  \n",

    "_A<sub>t</sub> = X<sub>t</sub> + θ ⋅ A<sub>t-1</sub>_\n",

    "This is useful for simple cases but doesn’t capture delayed effects.\n",

    "This plot illustrates the simplicity of geometric adstock. Impression peaks during advertising and quickly decreases shortly afterwards. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use the Weibull Transformation?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Weibull distribution offers a flexible alternative that can mimic delayed impacts and various decay patterns in advertising. It introduces two parameters—**shape** (k) and **scale** (λ)—that allow the decay rate to change over time. This flexibility is crucial for real-world data where advertising effects aren’t immediate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Shape (k)**: Controls how quickly or slowly the effect builds and decays. For example:\n",
    "  - If \\( k > 1 \\), the impact starts slowly and then decays faster after peaking.\n",
    "  - If \\( k < 1 \\), the impact peaks early and decays gradually.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scale (λ)**: Determines when the effect begins. Larger values delay the start, modeling longer-lasting effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula**:  \n",

    "\n",
    "![WeibullDecay](weibull_adstock_1232024.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This plot illustrates the flexibility of the Weibull model. Here, impressions start to rise after the advertisement, peak later, and decay gradually—capturing a more realistic pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example R Code for Weibull Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate Weibull’s flexibility, consider this example where advertising spend begins in week 3, but the impact on sales doesn’t start until later.\n",

    "```r\n",
    "# Set seed for reproducibility\n",
    "set.seed(123)\n",
    "weeks <- 1:20\n",

    "       col = c(\"purple\", \"blue\"), lty = c(1, 2), pch = c(19, NA))\n",
    "```\n",
    "This code models delayed impact, showing how Weibull can create a realistic curve that rises after a delay and decays gradually—far more flexible than geometric adstock.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "For advertising campaigns where impact unfolds over time, the Weibull transformation provides a better fit than traditional adstock. With its flexible parameters, it allows us to capture delayed and complex decay patterns, making it ideal for campaigns with longer-lasting effects. By adjusting the **shape** and **scale** parameters, the Weibull transformation can model a range of response behaviors, from immediate impacts to gradual, delayed decays. \n",
    "\n",
    "In summary:\n",
    "- **Geometric Adstock**: Works for simple, immediate impacts with steady decline.\n",
    "- **Weibull Adstock**: Offers flexibility to model real-world, delayed, and non-linear advertising effects.\n",
    "\n",
    " Weibull’s flexibility proves to be a valuable addition to any marketing analytics toolkit.\n"
